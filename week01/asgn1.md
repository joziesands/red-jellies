Assignment 1
Imaginary Embedded System

Employees filling online orders at the grocery store have to pick all the items while manually checking the list on their phone. Once all the items are gathered, they unload, scan, and bag the full order at a checkout station. 

Since an employee is doing the shopping, it would save time and energy to have a mobile checkout stand on their cart. This would also automatically check the SKU of each item against the customers order.

This project requires:
- scale(0.25 - 5.0 lb.)
- barcode reader
- keypad
- bluetooth
- battery
